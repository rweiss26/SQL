#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
  AND Product='iPhone'

#3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
  JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
  ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
  AND length(order_id)=6

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? - AAA Batteries - 2.99
SELECT JanSales.Product, MIN(JanSales.price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
  AND product <> 'Product'

#5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
  AND product <> 'Product'
GROUP BY JanSales.Product

#6.Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

#7.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
    COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum) AS num_accts, 
    AVG(quantity*price) AS average_amount_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
  LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers 
  ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.quantity>2
