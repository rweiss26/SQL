WORK IN PROGRESS

/* Here I worked with a the data set "Pod Daily Calls" which explored orthopedic daily call volume sorted by specialty service line (Pod). Using this data, I determined average hold
times, abandonment call rate, and call volume by comparing findings from January 2022 through September 2023. *\

/* Average hold time by day per POD. *\

SELECT avg_hold_time, date, service_line
FROM BIT_DB.poddailycalls
WHERE service_line IN ("Sport_Med", "Upper_Ext")
GROUP BY date, service_line


SELECT service_line, date,
AVG(avg_hold_time) OVER (PARTITION BY date) AS "Avg"
FROM BIT_DB.poddailycalls
WHERE service_line IN ("Sport_Med", "Upper_Ext")
GROUP BY date, service_line

/* Average hold time by month per POD. *\

/* Percentage of abondoned calls by day per POD. *\

/* Percentage of abondoned calls by month per POD. *\

/* Total Percentage of abondoned calls by day per POD excluding 6400 service line. *\
